## Purpose of this branch 
This branch purposed for deploy Balda's __backend__ on Heroku.  

## Where It works 
For now I deployed only backend part of **Balda** which is [here](https://balda-play.herokuapp.com/).  
It will react only on HTTP requests and return row json as a response. For test functionality enter that URL: `https://balda-play.herokuapp.com/api/get/users` which returns all users of Balda.
